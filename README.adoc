[[installation]]
== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'alki'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install alki

== How to use Alki

Alki simplifies project organization by pulling out all of the "connective tissue"
that connects your classes and modules together.
Alki provides a central place to build your application objects,
where they can easily refer to other objects,
and access configuration settings.

For example,
if your project has an http client

.my_project/http_client.rb
```ruby
module MyProject
  class HttpClient
    ...
  end
end
```

you might normally use it by either creating a new instance of it when needed,
or directly calling methods on the class.

```ruby
client = MyProject::HttpClient.new
client.get '/page1.html'
# -or-
MyProject::HttpClient.get '/page1.html'
```

With Alki, you would instead define instructions for how to build the http client.

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  service :http_client do
    require 'my_project/http_client'
    MyProject::HttpClient.new
  end
end
```

The 'service' method defines a new object with the name 'http_client',
and the provided block contains the code needed to build it.

To use the http client, an "Assembly" for the project has to be created.
Assemblies are container objects that hold your application objects once
they're built.

Typically you can just add the following code to your project's main library file.
More information can be found about this method http://alki.io/assemblies/project_assemblies.html[here].

.lib/my_project.rb
```ruby
require 'alki'
Alki.project_assembly!
```

This will add a 'new' method to the the MyProject module,
which will return a new Assembly instance.
The http client can be accessed by calling the method that matches the name we chose for it
when it was defined,
'http_client'.

```ruby
require 'my_project'

app = MyProject.new
app.http_client.get '/page1.html'
```

=== Configuration Settings

Most projects, at some point,
have to deal with configuration settings.

In Ruby the typical pattern is to reference Modules and Classes directly,
either by constructing them on demand when needed,
or calling class methods on them.

Often this leaves Modules and Classes to essentially have to configure themselves.
Sometimes this is by pulling configuration from the environment or a configration file,
sometimes it's by requiring a global variable to be set before the class is used.

This means that classes are often cluttered with configuration code.
Classes from different libraries might have different, inconsistent ways of being configured,
and it can be difficult if not impossible to change how they're configured.

In Alki, configuration becomes straightforward.
Classes can just take configuration settings as initializer parameters,
without worrying about where they comes from.

.lib/my_project/http_client.rb
```
module MyProject
  class HttpClient
    def initializer(base_uri)
      @base_uri = base_uri
    end
    ...
  end
end
```

Then the Assembly can be updated to pass in a configuration parameter.
We can also define a new element for our base_url setting.

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  set :http_base_url do
     ENV.fetch('HTTP_BASE_URL')
  end

  service :http_client do
    require 'my_project/http_client'
    MyProject::HttpClient.new http_base_url
  end
end
```

The 'set' method is used to define simple values in the Assembly,
and the http client can refer to it by name.

Nothing changes with how we use the http client,
but it's now pulling it's configuration from the environment.

Changing this to have a default value,
pull from a different source,
or have multiple clients with different configuration parameters
can be done easily without changing the class code.

For example,
to change the settings to come from a YAML file we can define a new
element to parse the YAML file,
and then redifine our setting to pull it's value from the parsed options.
Note that the order doesn't matter.
Even if a dependency is defined after an element that uses it,
the objects will still be built in the correct order.

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  set :yaml_settings do
    require 'yaml'
    YAML.load_file File.join(config_dir,'settings.yml')
  end

  set :http_base_url do
    yaml_settings['http_base_ur']
  end

  service :http_client do
    require 'my_project/http_client'
    MyProject::HttpClient.new http_base_url
  end
end
```

No changes to the class,
or in this case even the build code for the http client,
are required.

Configuration settings can be grouped together in the assembly,
to namespace them.
This group can be called anything, but we'll call it 'settings'.

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  group :settings do
    set :http_base_url do
      yaml_settings['http_base_ur']
    end

    set :yaml_settings do
      require 'yaml'
      YAML.parse(File.read(File.join(config_dir,'settings.yml')))
    end
  end

  service :http_client do
    require 'my_project/http_client'
    MyProject::HttpClient.new settings.http_base_url
  end
end
```

The can also be moved to an entirely different file to keep them
seperate from your application objects.

.config/settings.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  set :http_base_url do
    yaml_settings['http_base_ur']
  end

  set :yaml_settings do
    require 'yaml'
    YAML.parse(File.read(File.join(config_dir,'settings.yml')))
  end
end
```

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  load :settings

  service :http_client do
    require 'my_project/http_client'
    MyProject::HttpClient.new settings.http_base_url
  end
end
```

== Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a way of designing your classes to maximise
their modularity and reusability.

Much like with configuration settings,
instead of directly referencing a classes dependencies a depenency injected
class takes it's dependencies as arguments.

The advantage of this is that classes can be developed and tested in isolation,
can have dependencies easily changed by other code (like users of a library),
or have multiple instances with different dependencies.

Like configuration settings,
a lot of Ruby projects end up needing some amount of dependency injection,
but it's typically implemented in an ad-hoc way with class variables or other global
variables.

With Alki, dependency injection is the norm and very straightforward.

Perhaps we have client for API that works over HTTP.
We can write our API client so that it takes an HTTP client as an arugment
and just calls methods on it.
It doesn't need to pick a particular client library or decide what configuration
settings it should have.

.lib/my_project/api_client.rb
```ruby
module MyProject
  class ApiClient
    def initialize(http_client)
      @http_client = http_client
    end

    def all
      parse_response @http_client.get('/all.json')
    end

    ...
   end
end
```

With this design it's easy to change out the http client,
or provide a stubbed or mocked one for testing.
It maximizes the reusability of our API client
because it only handles one thing
(Single Responsibility Principle). 

To add it to the previous assembly definition.

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
  load :settings

  service :api_client do
    require 'my_project/api_client'
    MyProject::ApiClient.new http_client
  end

  service :http_client do
    require 'my_project/http_client'
    MyProject::HttpClient.new settings.http_base_url
  end
```

== Example

[NOTE]
Full "todo" source code can be found https://github.com/alki-project/alki-examples/tree/master/todo[here]

To demonstrate how a full Alki project can be put together,
we'll go through an example application.
This application is a little todo list command line utility
that stores the todo list in a json file.

.lib/todo.rb
```ruby
require 'alki'
Alki.project_assembly!
```

This will create a module called `Todo` that is an empty assembly:

```
$ bundle exec irb -Ilib
2.4.0 :001 > require 'todo'
 => true
2.4.0 :002 > todo = Todo.new
 => #<Todo:21964520>
```

[[defining-elements]]
=== Defining Elements

Adding things to the assembly requires an Assembly definition file.
By convention this is named `config/assembly.rb` and is built using a DSL.
There are a handful of different element types in Assemblies.
Elements can refer to other elements, and can be defined in any order.

Full documentation of the DSL can be found http://alki.io/dsl/[here].

Below is an example Assembly definition for the todo application
which uses a few of the core element types.

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  load :settings

  service :interface do
    require 'todo/readline_interface'
    Todo::ReadlineInterface.new settings.prompt, handler
  end

  service :handler do
    require 'todo/command_handler'
    Todo::CommandHandler.new db
  end

  service :db do
    require 'todo/store_db'
    Todo::StoreDb.new file_store
  end

  service :file_store do
    require 'todo/json_file_store'
    Todo::JsonFileStore.new settings.db_path
  end
end
```

Along with a settings file to define our application settings.

.config/settings.rb
```ruby
Alki do
 set(:home) { ENV['HOME'] }
 set(:db_path) { ENV['TODO_DB_PATH'] || File.join(home,'.todo_db') }
 set :prompt, 'todo> '
end
```

Settings and services can be accessed by requiring the main "lib/todo.rb" file,
creating a new assembly instance,
and then calling methods to refer to the different elements.

```
$ bundle exec irb -Ilib
2.4.0 :001 > require 'todo'
 => true
2.4.0 :002 > todo = Todo.new
 => #<Todo:21964520>
2.4.0 :003 > todo.settings.prompt
 => "> "
2.4.0 :004 > todo.interface.run
> ?
All commands can be shortened to their first letters
print
add <description>
edit <id> <description>
complete <id>
uncomplete <id>
remove <id>
move <from> <to>
quit

```

The http://alki.io/projects/alki-console.html[alki-console] developer console gem can also be used to quickly work with assemblies.
It can be used by adding `gem 'alki-console'` to the Gemfile and running `bundle --binstubs` to add the console script to the 'bin' directory.

Elements can be accessed directly without having to manually create an
assembly instance.

```
$ bin/alki-console
todo> settings.prompt
=> 'todo> '
```

[[executable]]
### Creating an executable

Read more about creating executables with Alki,
including how to create executables to distribute in a gem,
http://alki.io/assemblies/executables.html[here]

In the todo example, it's a CLI utility so it requires an executable.
The executable just needs to require the main project file,
create a new instance of the assembly,
and call a method on a service.

.bin/todo
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# Setup 
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'alki/bin'

require 'todo'
Todo.new.interface.run
```

```
$ bin/todo
> print
1. take out the trash
> quit
$
```
