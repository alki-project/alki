# What is Alki?

Alki is a small framework for Ruby that provides a powerful dependency injection and program
management system with helpers for testing, creating executables, and writing DSLs.

It's goal is to remove uncertainty and friction when building Ruby projects, allowing developers to focus on
implementing business logic. It can be used alongside other frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.

Alki tries to combine time tested software engineering concepts such as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)[SOLID],
and  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control[Inversion of Control], with
Ruby style ease of use, DSLs, and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration[Convention over Configuration].

## Getting Started

Install from rubygems

    gem install alki

Setting up Alki in your project requires only creating a couple of files, but the
`alki` command line tool can also be used to automate the process. Project names
should be given in lowercase using underscores and forward slashes as separators.

.Example project
```
$ cd <project dir>
$ alki init --addons console <project name>
```
